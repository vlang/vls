# vls
[![CI](https://github.com/vlang/vls/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vlang/vls/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

VLS (V Language Server) is a LSP v3.15-compatible language server
for [the V programming language](https://github.com/vlang/v).

> VLS is a work-in-progress, pre-alpha language server.
It may not be guaranteed to work reliably on your system
due to memory management issues and other factors.

# Installation
You need to have Git and V installed before compiling the language server.
You need to execute the following:
```
## Install the tree-sitter grammar for V first:
git clone https://github.com/nedpals/tree-sitter-v ~/.vmodules/tree_sitter_v

## Clone the project at the use-tree-sitter branch:
git clone https://github.com/vlang/vls.git --branch use-tree-sitter vls && cd vls/

## Build the project
## NOTE: `-gc boehm` flag is very important or it may cause leaks! 
v -gc boehm cmd/vls
# The binary will be created in the subfolder `cmd/vls` by default.
```

## Usage
> **NOTE:** VLS only officially supports VSCode for now ([vls#52](https://github.com/vlang/vls/issues/52)).

In order to use the language server, you need to have a text editor with support for LSP. In this case, the recommended editor for testing (for now) is to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [vscode-vlang](https://github.com/vlang/vscode-vlang) extension version 0.1.4 or above installed.

Afterwards, go to your editor's configuration and scroll 
to the V extension section. From there, enable VLS by checking
the box and input the absolute path of the `vls` language server executable.
If you cloned the repository and compiled it from source, the executable
will be in the `cmd/vls` directory. So make to add `cmd/vls/vls`.

## Debugging
> By default, log can only be accessed and saved on server crash.
To save the log on exit, pass the `--debug` flag to the language server CLI. 

VLS provides a log file (`${workspacePath}/vls.log`) for debugging language
server for certain situations (e.g unexpected crash). To read the contents
of the `vls.log` file, simply upload the file to the
[LSP Inspector](https://iwanabethatguy.github.io/language-server-protocol-inspector/)
and select `vls.log`.

### Error Reporting
If you encounter a crash in the language server, be sure to attach the `vls.log`
file when [submitting an issue](https://github.com/vlang/vls/issues/new).
