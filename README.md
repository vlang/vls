# V Language Server
[![CI](https://github.com/vlang/vls/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vlang/vls/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

V Language Server (also known as "VLS") is a LSP v3.15-compatible language server for [the V programming language](https://github.com/vlang/v).

# Download / Installation
### Pre-built/Precompiled Binaries (Recommended)
Pre-built binaries for Windows (x64), MacOS (x64/M1), and Linux (x64) can be found [here](https://github.com/vlang/vls/releases/latest).

### VSCode
The official [V VSCode extension](https://github.com/vlang/vscode-vlang) provides a way to automatically download and install VLS by checking the "Enable VLS" in the extension settings in which a message prompt will appear for you to install VLS.

### Build from Source
> **NOTE**: TCC, the default compiler shipped with V, is not recommended ATM due to
> some issues in the Tree Sitter's output.

To build the language server from source, you need to have the following:
- GCC/Clang (Latest),
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
- [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) (0.2.2 and later).

Linux and MacOS users are also expected to install the Boehm GC library.
- For Debian/Ubuntu users: `sudo apt-get install libgc-dev`
- For MacOS (via Homebrew): `brew install bdw-gc`

Afterwards, open your operating system's terminal and execute the following:
```
## Clone the project:
git clone https://github.com/vlang/vls && cd vls

## Build the project
## Use " v run build.vsh gcc" if you're compiling VLS with GCC.
v run build.vsh clang

# The binary will be created in the current root directory `vls`.
```

## Setup / Usage
To use the language server, you need to have an editor with [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) support. See [this link](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/) for a full list of supported editors.

### VSCode, VSCodium, and other derivatives
> [GitHub Web Editor](https://github.dev) is not supported yet at this moment. See this [issue comment](https://github.com/vlang/vscode-vlang/issues/272#issuecomment-898271911).

For [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and other derivatives, all you need to do is to install 0.1.4 or above versions of the [V VSCode extension](https://github.com/vlang/vscode-vlang). Afterwards, go to settings and scroll to the V extension section. From there, enable VLS by checking the "Enable VLS" box.

If you have VLS downloaded in a custom directory, you need to input the absolute path of the `vls` language server executable to the "Custom Path" setting. If you cloned the repository and compiled it from source, the executable will be in the `vls` root directory. So make sure to add `vls/vls` or `vls/vls.exe` (for Windows).

### Other Editors
> VLS on JetBrain IDEs does not work at this moment. See [issue 52](https://github.com/vlang/vls/issues/52) for more details.

For other editors, please refer to the plugin's/editor's documentation for instructions on how to setup an LSP server connection.

## Debugging
VLS provides a log file (`${workspacePath}/vls.log`) for debugging the language server incoming requests and outgoing responses / notifications. By default, this can only be saved and accessed on server crash. To save the log on every exit, pass the `--debug` flag to the language server CLI.
